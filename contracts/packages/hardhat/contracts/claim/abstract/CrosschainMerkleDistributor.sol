/**
 * @title CrosschainMerkleDistributor
 * @author
 * @notice Distributes funds to beneficiaries listed in a merkle proof on Connext-compatible chains. If a beneficiary is listed in multiple leaves,
  * they can claim at most the max(amounts) rather than sum(amounts) -- each beneficiary gets a single distribution record across all chains or merkle leaves.
 *
 * @dev There are three ways to claim funds from this contract:
 *
 * 1. `claimBySignature` allows any address to claim funds on behalf of an EOA beneficiary to any Connext domain and recipient address (including recipients and domains not in the merkle leaf) by providing a merkle proof and beneficiary signature
 * 2. `claimByMerkleProof` allows any address to claim funds on behalf of a beneficiary to the Connext domain and address specified in the merkle leaf by providing a merkle proof
 * 3. `xReceive` allows any address on another Connext domain to claim funds on behalf of a beneficiary to the connext domain and address specified in the merkle leaf by providing a merkle proof
 *
 * A note on the merkle tree structure:
 *
 * The leaf structure used is: `hash(beneficiary, total, beneficiaryDomain)`.
 *
 * The contract is designed to support claims by both EOAs and contracts. If the beneficiary
 * is a contract, the merkle leaf domain must match the contract domain. In this case, you can only guarantee the beneficiary
 * controls their address on the domain the claim was initiated from (contracts do not share
 * addresses across chains). Including the domain context in the leaf allows the contract to
 * enforce this assertion via merkle proofs instead of using an authorized call (see:
 * https://docs.connext.network/developers/guides/authentication).
