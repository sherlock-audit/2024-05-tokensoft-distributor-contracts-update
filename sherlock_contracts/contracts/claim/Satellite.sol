 * @title Satellite
 * @notice This contract allows a beneficiary to claim tokens to this chain from a Distributor on another chain.
 * This contract validates inclusion in the merkle root, but only as a sanity check. The distributor contract
 * is the source of truth for claim eligibility.
 *
 * @dev The beneficiary domain in the merkle leaf must be this contract's domain. The beneficiary address may be
 * an EOA or a smart contract and must match msg.sender. The Satellite contract(s) and CrosschainDistributor contracts must only
 * be deployed on chains supported by the Connext protocol.
 *
 * Note that anyone could deploy a fake Satellite contract that does not require msg.sender to match the beneficiary or the Satellite
 * domain to match the beneficiary domain. This would allow the attacker to claim tokens from the distributor on behalf of a beneficiary onto
 * the chain / domain specified by that beneficiary's merkle leaf. This is not a security risk to the CrosschainMerkleDistributor,
 * as this is the intended behavior for a properly constructed merkle root.
